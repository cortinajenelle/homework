      <h2>Case Study on Creative Facilitation</h2>
      <div></div>
<p> Developed and tested by Peggy Taylor and Charlie Murphy, the Creative Empowerment model has been passed into the hands of
creative facilitators through trainings, a published book entitled "Catch the Fire: An Art-Full Guide to Unleashing the Creative
Power of Youth, Adults and Communities", as well as special workshops, presentations and recordings. The book and the work of spreading
creative facilitation was done under the premise that community, youth, nonprofit, education, entrepreneurial, and religious organizations
all have exciting ambitions, but they often lack the creative skills to impact people on a deeper level. Yet, in order to meet today's
demand for diverse, equitable and inclusive environments all community, youth, nonprofit, education, entrepreneurial, and religious organizations
around the world will have to sort out how to shift from harm to positive impact for their stakeholders and more importantly, internal teams.
Diversity, equity and inclusion work begins long before anybody ever sets foot through your door and will continue long after the last person has left.
It is simply a way of being and relating with awareness. According to Harvard Business Review, the diversity represented in leadership roles is on the rise.
Many employers that successfully retain a diverse workforce cite that a truly inclusive workplace is one that has also taken strides to establish trust, open
communication, accountability and integrity. There is no cookie cutter formula that will work for every space all of the time. However, these are some essential
principles that can work for most. According to scientific research published by the World Happiness Index and others credible bodies of research, creativity is pivotal for morale,
innovation and teamwork. Using creativity in the workplace can improve the teamâ€™s problem-solving skills and when practiced regularly, can
allow more complex issues (i.e. racial or gender inequities) to be addressed because of the trust and vulnerability that has been established
in the process of creative process. In addition, with regards to leadership or people-oriented jobs, creativity can help build resilience,
provide social-emotional building blocks for tough conversations and be an outlet for the grief, sadness or anger that comes along with change.
For all these reasons and more, Facilitation for Equity + Engagement uses a Creative Empowerment methodology through a creative facilitation
practice in order to guide groups, clients and communities through the tension of addressing disparities.</p>

  <li class="creativity-benefits">Furthermore, research reveals the following benefits of creativity in the workplace:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Better teamwork and team bonding.</li>
    <li>Increased workplace engagement and interaction.</li>
    <li>Improved ability to attract and retain quality employees.</li>
    <li>Increased staff morale, fun and happiness.</li>
    <li>Increased workplace problem-solving and productivity.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
<p>Creative problem-solving increases the likelihood of discovering novel approaches that no one else has considered which meets the
imaginative, forward-thinking approach that equity and inclusion demands. In spaces where equity is not yet the norm, creativity and/or creative
facilitation can break up the autopilot that prevents us from designing for those that are present or most impacted. Creative facilitation as a
tool can provide soft skills pivotal in professional development so that leaders learn how to celebrate difference, promote diversity or encourage
creativity and then pass that on to their teams. Talent and skill can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. When you explore bringing creativity into
your diversity, equity and inclusion work, you may discover that you can accomplish more than you ever imagined, and with less pushback. In addition,
working creatively can help boost your mood and reduce stress. It can also be a fantastic way to connect with others as you share your creative work
with them and create an air of excitement to tackle system changes. Participating in more creative meetings and workshops might be a great
way to spice the workday.
